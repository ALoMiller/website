## VISION & ETHOS 

Our vision is that we can uncover environmental solutions faster if we are more efficient and collaborative with how we do science. 

Openscapes is about opening the landscapes of science through community, data, and code. It means open science: open data, open knowledge, and using the internet for good. But, importantly, it also means open culture: collaboration, empathy, and kindness. It is about creating the positive culture we want in science, so we can do better science in less time.

## OUR STORY

[draft!!]

Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis ([NCEAS](/about#NCEAS)) and is being incubated by a [Mozilla](/about#MOZILLA) Fellowship awarded to [Julia Stewart Lowndes](/about#).


The Openscapes story starts at NCEAS, a prestigious ecology center that upcycles and analyzes data to help solve environmental challenges. One group at NCEAS is the Ocean Health Index, which measures how healthy oceans are using the best data and science available. In 2013, even though they did XYZ, they struggled to repeat their own data wrangling due to files with names like "data_analysis_final_v2b.xls" they emailed each other with ambiguous email subject lines like "fwd:RE:Data question". You know the ones.

The Ocean Health Index team overcame these bookkeeping and reproducibility nightmares by leveraging open source tools and practices used by software engineers, and learned them by engaging with the welcoming online community that xyz. Transforming the efficiency of their science but also their impact through new communication channels like building websites and online books, the team wanted to share their story beyond the ocean health community. In 2017, Julia Lowndes led a publication about the team's journey in the scientific journal *Nature Ecology & Evolution* called **Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools** [Lowndes et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). <!---This, along with joining and building local and online open data science communities, would set the stage for more. --->

In fall 2018 Julia becomes a Fellow with Mozilla — yes, the internet advocacy group that brings you Firefox. Mozilla supports and mentors Julia as she operationalizes the ideas presented in the *Nature* paper, which starts with the vision and ethos of Openscapes. Ben Halpern, the director of NCEAS, welcomes Openscapes as part of the environmental data science pillar, part of NCEAS' core mission. The Openscapes Champions program comes into focus, with the pilot cohort springing from informal conversations that Julia has had with colleagues over several years. One of these Champions is Allison Horst, and during hikes in the Santa Barbara mountains that focus on data science, discussions turn to art and Allison was able to capture the feeling of Openscapes in many open landscapes. 

Openscapes is about opening the landscapes of science, and sharing stories is part of welcoming others to engage in the open practices that are game-changing for science. We think everyone can identify with this story, whether they are trying to recreate a figure they made previously, sift through emails from their colleagues, or ask for help with data analysis. We scientists are all in this together, let's do better science in less time.

## NCEAS

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact.

## JULIA STEWART LOWNDES

Julia (or Julie) is a marine data scientist and Mozilla Fellow (2019). She works to increase the value and practice of open environmental science by empowering researchers with existing open tools and communities. She has been working in this space since 2013 at NCEAS with the Ocean Health Index. She earned her PhD at Stanford University studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid. She is a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor and a co-founder of [Eco-Data-Science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) and [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). [Learn more](jules32.github.io) about Julia and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliesquid).

## ART BY ALLISON HORST

[draft in progress:]

Allison Horst is a [lecturer of data science and statistics](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/people/Faculty/allison_horst.htm) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and an artist in residence at NCEAS. With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally; see her [stats illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allison_horst).

Here are Allison's Openscapes ecosystems:

## WEBSITE

The Openscapes website was created by Julia Lowndes — using the same open data science workflows she uses for research and promotes through Openscapes. The website is created with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), using the [hugo-universal-theme](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-universal-theme/).
