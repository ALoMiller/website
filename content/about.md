Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis ([NCEAS](/about#NCEAS)) and is being incubated by a [Mozilla](/about#MOZILLA) Fellowship awarded to [Julia Lowndes](/about#our-team).

## OUR STORY

The Openscapes story starts with file names like "data_analysis_final_v2b.xls" — you know the ones. 

In 2013, when a team of scientists at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) was leading the second annual Ocean Health Index assessment, they found themselves struggling with unruly documentation buried in forwarded emails and knew they needed to find a better way to analyze data in a collaborative way. 

So they turned to open source tools and practices – the same used by software engineers for collaborative projects. These resources and the supportive online communities around them were game-changers. Not only did the efficiency of the team's analyses increase, so too did their impact and reach thanks to open source communication channels. They found these results so empowering that they shared their story with the scientific community through [a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) in *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, led by Openscapes founder Julia Lowndes. 

The ideas in that paper seeded the vision for Openscapes, and that vision became a reality in the fall of 2018, when Mozilla (yes, the internet advocacy group that brings you Firefox) awarded Julia a fellowship to launch the initiative. The long-term home of Openscapes will be with NCEAS, as an important component of its work in environmental data science and training. 

As Openscapes moves forward, we look forward to opening the landscapes of science and sharing more stories to help create an efficient, open culture for science. If you work in the environmental science realm, we invite you to be part of this story. 

We are all in this together. Let’s do better science in less time.

## NCEAS

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact.

## OUR TEAM

Openscapes has many supportive contributors at NCEAS, Mozilla, and the broader open community. 

**Julia Stewart Lowndes** (also Julie) is the founding lead of Openscapes. She is a marine data scientist and Mozilla Fellow at NCEAS, working to increase the value and practice of open environmental science by empowering researchers with existing open tools and communities. She has been building communities of practice in this space since 2013 with the Ocean Health Index after earning her PhD at Stanford University studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. She is a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor and lead creator of the Ocean Health Index's [open data science training](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/), and is a co-founder of [Eco-Data-Science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) and [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/).

## OPENSCAPES ART

Allison Horst creates original art for Openscapes as an artist in residence at NCEAS. Allison is a [lecturer of data science and statistics](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/people/Faculty/allison_horst.htm) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara. With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally; see her [stats illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allison_horst). You can see all of Allison's Openscapes ecosystems [here](/openscapes_art).

## WEBSITE

The Openscapes website was created by Julia Lowndes — using the same open data science workflows she uses for research and promotes through Openscapes. The website code is on [github](https://github.com/openscapes/website), and is created with RStudio's [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), using the [hugo-universal-theme](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-universal-theme/).
