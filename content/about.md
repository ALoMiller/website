## VISION & ETHOS 

Our vision is that we can get to environmental solutions faster if we are more efficient and collaborative with how we do science. 

Openscapes is about opening the landscapes of science through community, data, and code. It means open science: open data, open knowledge, and using the internet for good. But, importantly, it also means open culture: collaboration, empathy, and kindness. It is about creating the positive culture we want in science, so we can do better science in less time.

## ORIGIN STORY

[draft!!]

Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS) and is being incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Julia Stewart Lowndes.


The Openscapes story starts at [NCEAS](/about/#NCEAS), a prestigious ecology center that upcycles and analyzes data to help solve environmental challenges. One project was the Ocean Health Index, which XYZ. Even though they did XYZ, they struggled to repeat their own data wrangling due to `data_analysis_final_v2b.xls` and ambiguous email subject lines like `fwd:RE:Data question`. The OHI team overcame these bookkeeping and reproducibility nightmares by leveraging open source tools and practices used by software engineers, and learned them by engaging with the welcoming online community that xyz. Transforming the efficiency of their science but also their impact through new communication channels like building websites and online books, the OHI team wanted to share their story beyond the ocean health community. In 2017 Julia Lowndes led a publication in the scientific journal Nature Ecology & Evolution called **Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools** [Lowndes et al. 2017](). Fast forward one year, and enter [Mozilla](/about/#Mozilla). Yes, the internet advocacy group that brings you Firefox. Julie Lowndes becomes a Mozilla Fellow to operationalize her work presented in the Nature paper. Ben Halpern, the director of NCEAS, welcomes Openscapes as part of the environmental data science pillar, part of NCEAS' core mission. The Champions program comes into focus, with the pilot cohort formalizing several years of chats that Julie has had with colleagues. One of these Champions is Allison Horst, and hikes in the Santa Barbara mountains that intensely R-heavy, discussions turn to art and Allison captures the feeling of Openscapes through open landscapes. 

This is what we are about. About sharing our story and welcoming others to engage in open practices and data science that are game-changing for science. We think everyone can identify with this story, whether they are trying to recreate a figure they made previously, sift through emails from their advisor, or ask for help with data analysis. We're all in this together, let's make it better and do better science in less time. 

But this isn't about who we are, it's about what we're doing, which is BSILT. But why Openscapes? It sounds better than BSILT.  By open scapes we mean opening the landscapes of science. 

Whether it's x, y, or `fwd:re:whoops wrong version attached`

Notes: get into weeds too quickly about OHI and NCEAS and about bsilt. we're not fictionalizing it but we are going to tell it in a fictional style



What does Openscapes mean? Opening the landscapes of science.

## NCEAS

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact. [Learn more](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) about NCEAS, [subscribe](http://ucsb.us12.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=d7494403ed9d8c97a5479f0d4&id=bbef3949b4) to the newsletter, and follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nceas) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NCEASUCSB/).

## MOZILLA

Mozilla exists to guard the open nature of the Internet and to ensure it remains a global public resource, open and accessible to all. They invest in thinking, leaders, and campaigns that have a meaningful impact today -- and that also lay the groundwork for a major shift in how the public, companies, and governments think about the Internet over the next 5 - 10 years.

## JULIA STEWART LOWNDES

Julia (or Julie) is a marine data scientist and Mozilla Fellow (2019). She works to increase the value and practice of open environmental science by empowering researchers with existing open tools and communities. She has been working in this space since 2013 at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ( [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)), helping the [Ocean Health Index]() become a visible leader of open, reproducible, and collaborative practices for science and management by building a community of practice and communicating the teamâ€™s [path to better science in less time](). She earned her PhD at Stanford University studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid. She is a [Carpentries]() instructor and a co-founder of [Eco-Data-Science]() and [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](). [Learn more](jules32.github.io) about Julia and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliesquid).

## ART BY ALLISON HORST

[draft in progress:]

Allison Horst is a [lecturer of data science and statistics](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/people/Faculty/allison_horst.htm) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and an artist in residence at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally; see her [stats illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allison_horst).

Here are Allison's Openscapes ecosytems:
