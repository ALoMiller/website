**Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS) and is being incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Julia Stewart Lowndes.**

## VISION

We can get to environmental solutions faster if we are more efficient and collaborative with how we do science.

## ORIGIN STORY

[draft!!]

All stories start somewhere. This story starts at [NCEAS](), a prestigeous ecology center that upcycles nad analyzes data to help solve enviromental challenges. With all the pressing env challenges like xyz, we need to get to env solutions faster, we need better science in less time. The OHI team struggled and overcame their roadblocks by leveraging the best practices from software engineers, using collab tools and getting away from files like `data_final_v2b.xls` and `fwd:whatever`. The OHI team engages with these practices in large part because of the welcoming online community that xyz. OHI team shares their story the prestigous scientific journal "Nature, called "Our path to better science in LT". Fast forward one year, and enter [Mozilla](). Yes, the internet advocacy group that brings you Firefox. Julie Lowndes becomes a Mozilla Fellow to operationalize her work presented in the Nature paper. Ben Halpern, the director of NCEAS, welcomes Openscapes as part of the environmental data science pillar, part of NCEAS' core mission. The Champions program comes into focus, with the pilot cohort formalizing several years of chats that Julie has had with colleagues. One of these Champions is Allison Horst, and hikes in the Santa Barbara mountains that intensely R-heavy, discussions turn to art and Allison captures the feeling of Openscapes through open landscapes. 

This is what we are about. About sharing our story and welcoming others to engage in open practices and data science that are game-changing for science. We think everyone can identify with this story, whether they are trying to recreate a figure they made previously, sift through emails from their advisor, or ask for help with data analysis. We're all in this together, let's make it better and do better science in less time. 

But this isn't about who we are, it's about what we're doing, which is BSILT. But why Openscapes? It sounds better than BSILT.  By open scapes we mean opening the landscapes of science. 

Whether it's x, y, or `fwd:re:whoops wrong version attached`

Notes: get into weeds too quickly about OHI and NCEAS and about bsilt. we're not fictionalizing it but we are going to tell it in a fictional style



What does Openscapes mean? Opening the landscapes of science. 




## NCEAS

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact.

## JULIA LOWNDES

Julia is a marine data scientist and Mozilla Fellow (2019). She works to increase the value and practice of open environmental science by empowering researchers with existing open tools and communities. She has been working in this space since 2013 at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ( [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)), helping the [Ocean Health Index]() become a visible leader of open, reproducible, and collaborative practices for science and management by building a community of practice and communicating the teamâ€™s [path to better science in less time](). She earned her PhD at Stanford University studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid. She is a [Carpentries]() instructor and a co-founder of [Eco-Data-Science]() and [R-Ladies Santa Barbara]().

## ART BY ALLISON HORST

[draft in progress:]

Allison Horst is a [lecturer of data science and statistics](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/people/Faculty/allison_horst.htm) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and an artist in residence at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally; see her [stats illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allison_horst).
