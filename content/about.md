Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis ([NCEAS](/about#NCEAS)) and is being incubated by a [Mozilla](/about#MOZILLA) Fellowship awarded to [Julia Stewart Lowndes](/about#).

## OUR STORY

[draft!!]


The Openscapes story starts at NCEAS, a prestigious ecology center that upcycles and analyzes data to help solve environmental challenges. One group at NCEAS is the Ocean Health Index, which measures how healthy oceans are using the best data and science available. In 2013, when the team tried to repeat their own work and reassess ocean health, even though they had documented all their scientific methods, they struggled. This was largely due to their own data processing approaches the first time, which included files with names like "data_analysis_final_v2b.xls" they had emailed each other with vague email subject lines like "fwd:RE:Data question". You know the ones.

The Ocean Health Index team overcame these bookkeeping and reproducibility nightmares by leveraging open source tools and practices used by software engineers, and learned them because of supportive leadership, mentorship, and by engaging with the welcoming online community. They learned tools and practices that were game-changing for their science, not only transforming their efficiency but amplifying their impact through new distribution and communication channels like building websites and online books. The tools were so powerful and empowering, the team wanted to share their story beyond the ocean health community. In 2017, Julia Lowndes led a publication about the team's journey in the scientific journal *Nature Ecology & Evolution* called [**Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). <!---This, along with joining and building local and online open data science communities, would set the stage for more. --->

In fall 2018, Julia became a Fellow with Mozilla — yes, the internet advocacy group that brings you Firefox. Mozilla supports and mentors Julia as she operationalizes the ideas presented in the *Nature* paper, which seeded the vision and ethos of Openscapes. Ben Halpern, the director of NCEAS, welcomes Openscapes as part of the environmental data science pillar, part of NCEAS' core mission. The Openscapes Champions program comes into focus, with the pilot cohort springing from informal conversations that Julia has had with colleagues over several years. One of these Champions is Allison Horst, and during hikes in the Santa Barbara mountains that tend to focus on data science, discussions turn to art and Allison captures the feeling of Openscapes in many beautiful open landscapes. 

Openscapes is about opening the landscapes of science, and sharing stories is part of welcoming others to engage and create an efficient, open culture for science. We think environmental scientists can identify with parts of this story, whether they are trying to recreate a figure they made previously, sift through emails from their colleagues, or articulate how they need help with data analysis. We scientists are all in this together, let's do better science in less time.

## NCEAS

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact.

## OUR TEAM

Openscapes has many contributors and supporters at NCEAS, Mozilla, and the broader open community, and we are very appreciative.

**Julia Stewart Lowndes** (also Julie) leads Openscapes. She is a marine data scientist and Mozilla Fellow (2019), working to increase the value and practice of open environmental science by empowering researchers with existing open tools and communities. She has been working in this space since 2013 at NCEAS with the Ocean Health Index, building international communities of practice for ocean health. She earned her PhD at Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate, and was lucky to have mentors who gave her confidence to learn to code. She is a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor and creator of OHI's [open data science training](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/), and is a co-founder of [Eco-Data-Science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) and [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). [Learn more](http://jules32.github.io) about Julia and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliesquid).


**Allison Horst** creates original art for Openscapes as an artist in residence at NCEAS. Allison is a [lecturer of data science and statistics](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/people/Faculty/allison_horst.htm) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara. With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally; see her [stats illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) and follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allison_horst). You can see all of Allison's Openscapes ecosystems [here](/openscapes_art).

## WEBSITE

The Openscapes website was created by Julia Lowndes — using the same open data science workflows she uses for research and promotes through Openscapes. The website code is on [github](https://github.com/openscapes/website), and is created with RStudio's [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), using the [hugo-universal-theme](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-universal-theme/).
