*This page is under development and currently leverages previous work*.  

This is a curated list of resources to welcome environmental scientists to deliberately engage in and be empowered by open tools and communities. It is not meant to be comprehensive of all the incredible resources out there, but put together based trying to meet the needs of scientists following real conversations.

## WORKING COLLABORATIVELY, OPENLY, & EFFICIENTLY

Science is collaborative â€” you work daily with your most most important collaborator: Future You. And, you are contributing to scientific knowledge and sharing insights with your lab members. 

Embrace existing open tools and workflows for science. There's not a single tool for all jobs, but can leverage existing workflows and streamline the amount of software (and user accounts) you need. For example, the Ocean Health Index describes its [path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) borrowing practices from software engineers, using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub for collaborative coding and communication.

## JOINING & BUILDING LEARNING COMMUNITIES

Learning to code should be fun, because you are learning powerful and empowering tools that will take your science to new heights. So do it with friends, and grow your community. 

- [start a coding club](/blog/2018/11/20/how-to-start-a-coding-club/)
- [join twitter for the open data science community](/blog/2018/12/06/twitter-for-community/)

## R WITH RSTUDIO AND GITHUB

Shared practices with emphasis on collaborating with Future You reduces coding errors, makes them easier to find, and facilitates code review. We recommend using R through the RStudio IDE, which not only provides a supportive infrastructure but enables direct connection to GitHub.com (i.e. without additional software or use of the command line). Further, workflows with the tidyverse & friends and RMarkdown create good practices for collaborative, reproducible workflows.

## OPENSCAPES MEDIA AND PRESENTATIONS

We have been openly communicating about the Openscapes program throughout its development. Here are a list of presentations, associated slide decks, and media about Openscapes.
