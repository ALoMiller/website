This is a curated list of resources to welcome environmental scientists to deliberately engage in and be empowered by open tools and communities. 

It builds off information from Lowndes et al and is R focused


It is not intended to be exhaustive and does not list all great resources out there. 



## COLLABORATION AND EFFICIENCY

Embrace existing tools. Not a single tool for all jobs, but can leverage existing workflows and streamline the amount of software (and user accounts) you need. For example

## R WITH RSTUDIO AND GITHUB

Shared practices with emphasis on collaborating with Future You reduces bugs, makes them easier to find, and facilitates code review. We recommend using R through the RStudio IDE, which not only provides a supportive infrastructure but enables direct connection to GitHub.com (i.e. without additional software or use of the command line). Further, workflows with the tidyverse & friends and RMarkdown create good practices for collaborative, reproducible workflows.
