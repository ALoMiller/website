*This page is under development and currently leverages previous work*.  

This is a curated list of resources to welcome environmental scientists to deliberately engage in and be empowered by open tools and communities. It is not meant to be comprehensive of all the incredible resources out there, but put together based trying to meet the needs of scientists following real conversations. <!---R focused for now --->

## WORKING COLLABORATIVELY, OPENLY, & EFFICIENTLY

The scope of environmental research spans vastly different ecosystems, scales, and organisms. But we are united by data: No matter what our questions are or how we gather information, we will need to analyze our data, and do so in a way that is efficient for ourselves and can be communicated to others. Thinking deliberately about data and embracing existing open tools and workflows for your science will increase your efficiency, broaden the scientific questions you can ask, introduce you to a network of online allies outside your scientific domain, and make it easier to ask for help.

For example, the Ocean Health Index describes borrowing practices from software engineers, using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub for collaborative coding and communication.

<!---
Embrace existing open tools and workflows for science. There's not a single tool for all jobs, but can leverage existing workflows and streamline the amount of software (and user accounts) you need.

What unites us not what makes us different

## JOINING & BUILDING LEARNING COMMUNITIES

Learning to code should be fun, because you are learning powerful and empowering tools that will take your science to new heights. So do it with friends, and grow your community. 

- [start a coding club](/blog/2018/11/20/how-to-start-a-coding-club/)
- [build communities on campus]
- [join twitter for the open data science community](/blog/2018/12/06/twitter-for-community/), rOpenSci, RLadies

<br>

## R WITH RSTUDIO & GITHUB

We recommend using R with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which not only provides a supportive infrastructure but enables direct connection to GitHub.com (i.e. without additional software or use of the command line). Further, workflows with RStudio's tidyverse & friends and with RMarkdown create good practices for collaborative, reproducible workflows.

## OPENSCAPES LESSONS, MEDIA, & PRESENTATIONS

We have been openly communicating about the Openscapes program throughout its development. Here are a list of presentations, associated slide decks, and media about Openscapes.
