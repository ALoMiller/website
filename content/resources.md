*This page is under development and currently leverages previous work*.  

This is a curated list of resources to welcome environmental scientists to deliberately engage in and be empowered by open tools and communities.

## WORKING COLLABORATIVELY, OPENLY, & EFFICIENTLY

Embrace existing tools. Not a single tool for all jobs, but can leverage existing workflows and streamline the amount of software (and user accounts) you need. For example

-OL!!!!
- Moore Fdn https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=lessons-from-our-work-in-data-driven-science
- BIDS, NSF?

## JOINING & BUILDING LEARNING COMMUNITIES

- [start a coding club](/blog/2018/11/20/how-to-start-a-coding-club/)
- [join twitter for the open data science community](/blog/2018/12/06/twitter-for-community/)

## R WITH RSTUDIO AND GITHUB

Shared practices with emphasis on collaborating with Future You reduces coding errors, makes them easier to find, and facilitates code review. We recommend using R through the RStudio IDE, which not only provides a supportive infrastructure but enables direct connection to GitHub.com (i.e. without additional software or use of the command line). Further, workflows with the tidyverse & friends and RMarkdown create good practices for collaborative, reproducible workflows.

## OPENSCAPES PRESENTATIONS

We have been openly communicating about the Openscapes program throughout its development. See slide decks here, and a list of presentations.
