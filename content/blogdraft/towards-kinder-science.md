## Towards kinder science

Yesterday I published a piece in Scientific American called [Open software means kinder science](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/). It is about how open source is not just about software but about community. And that it not only makes science better but also kinder.

I've been feeling and thinking about kinder science a lot but have only recently gotten bolder saying this out loud, because it can sound a bit strange. But I've found — from my own lived experience and through teaching and mentoring others — that an important step to participating in open science is to be jazzed about it. And that's about how it makes people feel as a human being as well as what it enables them to do. And how it can make them feel is awesome. 
 
But it's something I've started feeling more confident talking about, having spent time not only with the #rstats communities but also with open communities like Mozilla and FORCE. And it comes down to this: People get jazzed about open data science when we we talk about how awesome and empowering it makes you feel. 

This is really important, considering how much time modern scientists spend in front of a computer, managing, wrangling, analyzing, and communicating around data. If it is a demoralizing and lonely experience, that means scientists spend a good chunk of time feeling deflated and isolated. That is not how science is supposed to be, how innovation is supposed to happen! 

includes some things I've been thinking about and have started including in presentations: 

Open science is not just about improving the way we share data and methods; it is also about improving the way we think, work and interact with each other. It’s about technology enabling social infrastructure that can promote inclusivity to create kinder science. 

Kindness : getting bolder

Kicking  a lot of these ideas around for awhile. 

demoralizing and lonely analyses don't make for happy and innovative scientists
