I’ve had people ask me how RStudio could have a whole conference: “don’t they just make the software for the R console [the IDE]?” So many thoughts on how to answer that question. Starting with: 

The RStudio IDE is really powerful to ease new coders into the game. There is a friendly interface around what is often an intimidating console, a text editor for organizing scripts, direct interface with GitHub, environment and help pages, help loading packages. Plus, filepath and project management. 

But, RStudio is still not “just” that IDE, it’s code and packages. 

It’s not just packages, it’s deliberate theory and shared practices for analysis. And also huge power in communication: interactively with things like Shiny, and as books or websites with RMarkdown. And then, there’s also the positive culture that goes with their work.
