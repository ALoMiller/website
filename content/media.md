<!--- These slides are for a 45-minute seminar as a progress update 2 months into my Mozilla Fellowship. I give a tiny, brief taste of the inspiring work that Mozilla does, I talked about my Fellowship experiences so far, and the 2 projects I will do during my fellowship. I spent over half of the talk on the second project: I introduced the Openscapes program, including the vision, plan, and operations. The audience are environmental scientists at the weekly "roundtable" seminar at the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS). --->
