- What does Open Science mean to you?:
  - Open science makes it easier for you to repeat/continue your work if you come back to it months or years later, and for others to contribute
- I'm lucky because I get to learn in my job
- biggest differences/firsts: 
  - in person, not remote. Slide decks that were designed as essentially stand-alones every 2 weeks (so with baked-in redundancy and recaps) felt way too redudant when back-to-back. Plan: will tighten, remove redundancy so increase content. 
  - Not all teams had leads present; only 2 groups had leads present. So focus in those teams included not only developing plan is going forward, but how to get buyin from leads. Excited to share strategies and stories as they unfold.

## Summary



## What was it? 

2 day workshop with the series. Scott Large reachout to me, got funding, rallied 6 teams.

## What did we do? 
Talked about xyz. Intentional creating space to share and be vulnerable, modeling behavior we have learned from open and Moz community, but also grounded in sci community. NOAA

## Was it valuable? 

Yes: convos included things like xyz. Clubs shiny and SMAST. And testimonial from our post survey (change survey to "testimonial"? ). Ex of a group going forward: Scott's group. Where lead was present. Another example was xyZ, where lead was not present. 

## What's next? Follow up with these teams as they get going. 

Firsts: in person, closely tied network of teams, not all Pi's present. Upcoming post on nuts and bolts

*if you're interested, contact!*

These groups already have quite a bit of momentum in open data science, with many folks attending coding and using GitHub. But many didn't know each other, or know that they were allies. Shiny meetup. Quantfish woRkshops at SMAST.

On Day 1 we...

On Day 2 we...


## Cool things we learned

- Center for Conservation PeaceBuilding


## What worked

## Momentum: Case Studies (using Pathways)



### EDAB Team members:
Kim Bastille
Andy Beet
Rob Gamble
Scott Large
Sean Lucey
Currently a majority of the branch is using GitHub and open science practices, but excited to instill practices deliberately with the whole team. To do so, they plan to start a series of informal “Seaside” chats separate from regularly  meeting to introduce topics and start team members thinking about them. To include folks with geographic distance between group, they'll incorporate live google doc-ing (roll call) in their meetings, and staring to using GitHub as a project management tool (Issues). 

Probably need a 2-3 day workshop together to formalize code of conduct and one-on-one onboarding especially for GitHub, and to create "how we work" documents (like the [Pinsky Lab has done](). They are also trying to figure out the best workflow from Google Doc to Rmarkdown to include contributors outside of the team. 



## Reflections

Pathways forward focused on how to build these habits and momentum, rather than on specific tools or workflows. This 

I found myself telling rather than showing for too much of the time. When I made the slides for the inaugural cohort, I had fewer examples but now I have so many examples from Champions and shold show! sharing so many stories from the first inaugural Champions cohort, and I should bake this into the slides. I 


## What we'll improve upon

- clear statement in Overview that this is not all about R. Even though it is very heavily R. 
- add more stories from previous Champions cohorts, show what's possible
- add about broader open science/scholarship landscape: FORCE11 & publishing, open data repos Dryad/KNB/DataONE. FORCE11 community working on this, open publishing. PreReview, JOSS, rOpenSci, EOSS. Change rewards structure

- check out https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/design-ds-classroom/materials/02-teach-tidyverse/slides/02-teach-tidyverse.html#31 

- add more guidance about starting coding clubs. St

- notice that the vast majority is windows, need keyboard shortcuts!
- give better prompts for breakout groups
- pay attention to filepaths! And anchors. Eg: 
  - To Install R and RStudio and tidyverse for the first time: 
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites 
  - (knitted RMarkdowns allow anchoring urls: in the link above the #prerequisites title is a header within the introduction.Rmd file)



## Structure, from keep

## Slide updates
- CoC: learn more about current ideas "best intent"
- Twitter: I also follow people from Mozilla, DEI. I've learned a lot about the conversations going on, more than I would from my own office
- how to start coding clubs/ seaside chats/ hackathons. Examples that work, stories how they got started. If it's too much extra work or not fun, you're not going to do it. The best kind of exercise is what you'll actually do. Find this quote.
- source files: add modular workflows, sourcing files, knitting children
- if you're new to R, Swirl! Install R from r4ds. 
- BSILT: the whole Openscapes program is built around BSILT. Trying to operationalize this. It started with one Champion. not me. got buy-in. 


What am I missing from not using twitter?
Finding out info
Finding community
You have to learn how to sift through attitudes/frequency of tweets. Learn how to navigate
Gavin: StoryCollider workshop from twitter
You only follow the things you’re interested in
Plugin on my browser: enough time on twitter, shouldn’t you be working


Leaderful teams. Strong leadership, empower grass-roots. That's me!
