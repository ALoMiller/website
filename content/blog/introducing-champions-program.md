# Introducing the Champions program

*By engaging, empowering, and amplifying scientists with cross-cutting open data science approaches, Openscapes aims to create a more efficient and collaborative open culture in environmental science, to enable better science in less time. Openscapes centers around the Champions program, which is a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice.* 

----

The motivation for the Champions program is that there is huge potential for data science to accelerate  research and generate solutions to the pressing environmental problems. But many scientists are excluded from this because they lack “downstream” skillsets, mindsets, or support they would need to engage with such tools. In many environmental-related fields scientists have no formal training of any kind of computing or data analysis. <!---All too often, they reinvent the wheel and collaborate by forwarding files like “data_analysis_final_v2b.xls” to each other instead of coding collaboratively and leveraging the best open technology available. --->

Environmental scientists are a diverse community are united by an enormous need to work efficiently with data, and there is great opportunity to use collaborative open data science tools that already exist. However, a fundamental shift is needed in the environmental science community that prioritizes data science and provides emerging scientific leaders training in open practices to strengthen and accelerate their work. 


<!---
 most environmental scientists do data-intensive research but have no formal computing or data training. Scientists are getting by as graduate students but as they age up into leadership roles, they will pass these homegrown approaches to the next generation unless they have opportunities to experience and engage with better approaches using collaborative coding and open technology.

**Openscapes Champions will help catalyze the cultural shift towards open practices in environmental science.** We mentor early career researchers in leadership roles – faculty, lecturers, program managers, and others — along with members from their labs, with the idea that these emerging leaders will become champions for open practices and enable their labs without first becoming experts themselves. 

There are a lot of things to say about the Champions program, more for a single post. There will be additional posts following this one; I've organized this post to describe the operations of the program (modeled after [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/)), the content of what we're teaching (modeled after [Lowndes et al. 2017](https://nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)) and give an update of how it is going so far since launching earlier in January (one month in). 

## Operations

Openscapes Champions is a five-month mentorship program that is led remotely. Each month, there is individual mentorship for each Champion, and two "Cohort Calls" where we convene all Champions together, along with their lab members. Throughout, all participants learn about open practices and data science; strategize how to engage; meet other labs; set, review, and meet goals; and stay accountable.  

So how do you lead a remote program like this? You model it after [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/), which has developed a great program that they have repeatedly tested and improved over seven rounds. It takes a intense coordination, deliberate focus on creating a positive and inclusive culture, design to make calls engaging and interactive, Zoom, and Google Docs. (I think this is really cool how the intentions of the program are realized with the software tools available). I will focus on the software here, and have a whole separate post on culture. 

### Zoom and Google Docs

Participants all join Cohort Calls through Zoom, a video conferencing software that we use to interact in real time and also record the whole call as a resource for participants. In addition to accommodating large groups for discussions, it also has a great breakout room feature. Breakout rooms allows all participants to not only listen to lessons and discuss as a full group, but also lets them break into small groups to discuss topics. Following breakout groups, participants rejoin and summarize to the group both verbally and in writing, using Google Docs. 

Each call has an agenda written as a Google Doc to enable real-time participation. During the call, all participants have the agenda open, and follow along, writing their thoughts in specific places and participating in active shared note-taking. This is an [example pre-call agenda](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ia5-w8KiZgyZqX1ErGnrFihDAUAiAzkZwDfSgZw9BMU). Following the real-time writing and engagement during the Cohort Call, the agenda serves as a record of the discussions had that participants can revisit and anyone who missed can review. 


### Growth

The program architecture (both conceptually and physically with software, agendas, and planning) that Mozilla has developed is repeatable and scalable to serve future cohorts – as well as different disciplines and communities. The way the program can grow is clever: the coordination and content can be led by a small team that welcomes others from the open community to donate 1-2 hours of time per month to provide individual mentorship. This makes it possible to support more participants: the program could not scale if it required that I provide individual mentorship to more than 7-10 Champions at a time. Mozilla Open Leaders itself started off with one person mentoring ten participants, and now in its seventh round, serves six concurrent cohorts of participants with a community of mentors (many of whom were mentees in previous rounds).

For future cohorts, Openscapes candidates will nominate themselves and there will be a formal selection and review process. In this inaugural pilot cohort, I selected Champions with whom I had already been having informal discussions on these topics for months or years.


## Content

The Series is framed around [Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). That paper is a retrospective of how the Ocean Health Index workflow changed over four years; the Openscapes Series aims to help guide others to incrementally make progress themselves, no matter where they are starting from and where they hope to get. The first half of the series focuses on efficiency and open culture within the lab, and the second half is about sustained learning and bring these practices to the broader campus community.

And again, software plays a role in how this is actually able to happen.

## 1 month update

The Openscapes Champions program began in January and , with the inaugaral one-on-one mentorship calls last week and our first Cohort Calls this week. 

Our pilot cohort includes



## Looking ahead

By mentoring early career researchers in leadership roles, Openscapes helps create more champions for open, collaborative data practices. Openscapes complements existing efforts in this space (e.g. The Carpentries, rOpenSci) by working with scientists who have not yet engaged in open data practices, meeting them where they are, and facilitating their engagement with existing open tools and communities.

grow the community of practice by  mentoring and supporting scientists to champion open practices in their labs and departments, and further by amplifying Champions’ stories and successes, which will spark curiosity and draw new practitioners. 

This free, open-source curriculum is a resource for the Champions Program, for stand-alone workshops that are currently in design, and available for anyone to discover, use, and remix. It is based off of Lowndes et al. 2017 “Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools” and helps scientific leaders and their labs plan and begin their own paths.
