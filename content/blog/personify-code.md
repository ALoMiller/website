[Draft in progress!]

Anything and everything we do to increase visibility of open practices and data science within environmental science communities is important. When we see things, it is easier to value them. 

Openscapes Champion Allison Horst is doing this in part through her `personifyr` art series. She uses in the classroom at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where she is a lecturer of data science and statistics in an environmentally-focused graduate program. She also shares the series online, to the delight of the [#rstats Twitter community](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1068755043061571585). Through the `personifyr` series, Allison personifies different operations done in the programming language R.

`R` is an open source language with increasing functionality available at lower start up costs for new users. This is because of recently established norms and best practices developed by the diverse and inclusive online R community.

Allison's art represents these R operations and the spirit of the online community, who have appreciated her and asked for permission to use in their own classrooms. 

I am so impressed by the `personifyr` series in so many ways. Not only by Allison's artistic talent, which is broad and deep, spanning styles and media (fine art and digital) in ways I definitely appreciate but do not have the vocabulary to describe. But I am also so impressed by her ability to break down and communicate complex topics, and her creativity in representing it all. To imagine these programming operations as personalities, and to bring to life what they would be doing is such an incredible skill, full stop. And then to have the artistic ability to match (? or exceed?) is such a gift to us all. 

And, such a powerful way to engage and welcome the growing community (including scientists!) who will appreciate them even more.
