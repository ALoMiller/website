*At their closing keynote at the 2020 RStudio Conference, Hilary Parker and Roger Peng mentioned that they hatched the idea for their excellent [Not So Standard Deviations podcast](http://nssdeviations.com/) following their reunion at the [2015 rOpenSci unconf](https://unconf15.ropensci.org/). That statement went straight to my heart because it pin-pointed how I had been feeling throughout the week of RStudio Conference ("RStudio::conf") that I had been unable to name. At RStudio::conf, I was surrounded by so many of the incredible people I had met at that very same 2015 rOpenSci unconf ("runconf15"). These folks are visionaries and leaders, founding and leading global efforts in open source software and inclusive culture. I am so honored to know them, and to consider them allies and friends. RStudio::conf, a conference with 2400 people, felt cozy with their presence and with the visible efforts they have led to make R and beyond a welcoming, innovative space. In a follow-up to an earlier [blog summary of RStudio::conf(2020)](/blog/2020/02/04/rstudioconf-2020/), here I want to reflect on how important runconf15 was, and how truly unique and world-changing rOpenSci is.*

The 2020 RStudio Conference felt monumentous to me personally because it marked five years of me being in the #rstats community. #rstats has not only upgraded my analytical practices, but it has also changed the trajectory of my career and life, which I mentioned in my [2019 useR! keynote](/blog/2019/08/22/user-keynote/). What I could not do in that keynote was describe fully how important rOpenSci — the program, leadership, and community — is to me because I can't talk about it without my voice wavering with emotion. But here, written, I will try. 

My entryway to #rstats all started with a single person who welcomed me: [Karthik Ram](http://karthik.io/).

Karthik is a data scientist, an ecologist, and a world-changer. He not only co-founded, built up, and leads rOpenSci, but also efforts at the Berkeley Instititue of Data Science and the US Research Software Sustainability Institute, among a million other things. He is an incredibly warm, throughtful person, and he first said hello to me when he was co-teaching the [Open Science for Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/OSS) course at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu) where I am based (I was not attending). I met him in the hallway one day and he asked me about my work and told me a bit about rOpenSci. 

[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) brings software developers and users together to innovate on creating new coding tools and promoting open science. It does this by deliberately creating a friendly, positive environment where folks with different backgrounds and expertise feel welcome and comfortable to share ideas and innovate together. rOpenSci exists primarily online, through its extensive community-supported and ever-growing [R packages database](https://ropensci.org/packages/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ropensci) and Slack. It also catalyzes relationships and strengthens community through in-person "unconf" events, bringing community members physically together to collaborate on specific projects of their choice.

The [2015 rOpenSci unconf](https://unconf15.ropensci.org/) ("runconf15") was transformation for someone like me, so new to coding. Beforehand, I really thought that software was a static, untouchable and unalterable thing like a refrigerator that did Its Purpose, and too bad if it doesn't work quite right or limits your imagination. Honestly, my closest inkling that I could interact with software or software developers was through [Clippy](https://jules32.github.io/useR-2019-keynote/#59). But at runconf15, I learned not only that software developers were real people, that they were kind people. They were people who would take time to talk to a new user like me, and be interested in my use cases, questions, needs, and learning process. My colleague Jamie and I were able to talk with RStudio's Joe Cheng to discuss the limitations of working with raster map data in R. And then we blown away as Joe began coding a package to make rasters faster right before our eyes, in dialogue with us as we sat together.

Having these kind people all together ready to innovate does not happen by accident. It takes deliberate intent and attention to bringing us together and setting the tone in a comforatable space to interact. And this was the vision of rOpenSci. <!---modeled after SciFoo? More here--->

Although I didn't know it at the time, runconf2015 would be a huge turning point for my career and life. It also catalzyed [Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com/about-hilary-parker/) and [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/)'s [NSSD podcast](http://nssdeviations.com/), and I suspect played a fueling role with efforts that attendees have gone on to lead. To name a few, [Tracy Teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Teal) became executive director of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [Gabriela de Queiroz](https://k-roz.com/) turned [RLadies](https://rladies.org/) into a global movement, [Arfon Smith](https://www.arfon.org/) went on to lead the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/), and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) has developed so many open source, commercial, and educational projects, with their team and customer base growing by an [order of magnitude](https://rstudio.com/slides/rstudio-pbc/#32). 

rOpenSci made concerted efforts to continue building and nurturing this community after runconf15, and growing the community to be larger than strictly its attendees. This means leveraging the power of the internet, where conversations ignited at runconf15 was continued with enthusiasm and innovation.

If rOpenSci has created a powerful river of innovation with diverse streams of contributers, what I am trying to do with Openscapes is connect additional tributaries to this watershed. And I think that the most important thing I do is to pass forward what I've learned from these communities, and to introduce and welcome them to join. When we talk about the awesomeness of R communities in Openscapes, it's not only to encourage them to become a part of them, but also to extend its ethos and kick-start this kind of movement in science — for [kinder science](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/). 

Thank you rOpenSci leadership and the greater community for being so welcoming and supportive of me and everyone like me.
