***Last week Openscapes went to the RStudio Conference! TODO***



The 2020 RStudio Conference (also written `RStudio::conf(2020)`) kicked off with a gorgeous video about coral reefs and the message "marine science is data science". It was so inspiring it didn't immediately resonate with me how impactful this was: I was not at a marine biology conference, I was at a tech conference with over 2400 people. Before talks about machine learning, big data, and subsetting closures, `Rstudio::conf(2020)` started off with how critical coral reefs and oceans are to the planet.

By this point I had already been at the conference for two days, teaching a workshop called [R for Excel Users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/) with [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst), and teaching assistants [Jamie (Afflerbach) Montgomery](https://twitter.com/jamiecmonty) and [Jessica Couture](https://twitter.com/ECOuture9).
This workshop was a friendly intro to becoming a modern R user, full of tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, collaboration & reproducibility. Our It was aimed for Excel users who want to add or integrate R and RStudio into their existing data analysis toolkit, with the main intent on empowering participants to continue using R after the workshop. Stay tuned for a separate blog post about the R for Excel Users workshop!



RStudio::conf(2020) felt both familiar and monumentous. It felt familiar and cozy as I chatted with [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query) friends <!--- — some of whom I was meeting in-person for the first time — ---> following Chief Scientist Hadley Wickham's welcome, which emphasized the Code of Conduct (see my post about this from [last year's conf](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/02/19/rstudioconf/)). And the conference felt monumentous in a way I could not identify — until Hilary Parker and Roger Peng said in their Keynote that it had been five years since they reunited at the [2015 rOpenSci unconf](https://unconf15.ropensci.org/) and decided to start their [Not So Standard Deviations](http://nssdeviations.com/) podcast. I attended that rOpenSci unconf too, and thus 2020 marks five years of my involvement in the #rstats community — five years of having a more open and [kinder](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/) perspective on software, collaboration, science, and life. The importance of rOpenSci and the movement it has catalyzed also warrants a separate blog post, which is in the works.

But the absolute highlight of RStudio::conf(2020) was that [RStudio is now a Public Benefit Corporation](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/01/29/rstudio-pbc). This means that they "have codified our open-source mission into our charter, which means that our corporate decisions must both align with this mission, as well as balance the interests of community, customers, employees, and shareholders." Additionally, in their charter they have a emphasized focus not only on data science, but on scientific research. [JJ Allaire's keynote](https://rstudio.com/slides/rstudio-pbc/#32) announcing this received a standing ovation. This is huge. To me, this means that they are the Patagonia of Tech. They are the first tech company to be a certified "B Corp", and are a model to other companies around the world. I am so proud to be a part of this community. <!---https://rstudio.com/slides/rstudio-pbc/#32--->

There were many other inspiring talks — some that I saw live and many that I will watch later online since all talks were recorded and will be available from [resources.rstudio.com](https://resources.rstudio.com/). Highlights included talks by [Jeff Leek](https://twitter.com/juliasilge/status/1222616959222575104), [Desirée De Leon](https://twitter.com/juliasilge/status/1222621842524893184) (links are Twitter threads by [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge/))
