# Openscapes Summit reflections — exceeding high expectations 

*Openscapes aims to enable better science in less time by creating a more efficient and collaborative culture in science. In March 2019 we brought the [Champions in the inaugural cohort](https://openscapes.github.io/summit2019/) together for a Summit in Santa Barbara, California, supported by [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/) and hosted at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)).  The purpose was to meet in person, strengthen relationships, share lessons learned, problem solve, and ignite new collaborations. This is the first of several blogs, as an overview of the event and its outcomes.*

March acheived its first milestone: we brought the cohort together and really 

The Openscapes Champions Summit exceeded my (very high!) expectations. It occurred half-way through the program, after three months of one-on-one mentorship and cohort lessons ([learn more about the Champions program](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/introducing-the-openscapes-champions-program-daba0acad4c8) and [meet the Champions](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/openscapes-champions-incorporate-open-practices-in-their-science-7eefa07b8573)). Participants gathered knowing that open data science is powerful and knowing that it is important to me, but from my perspective they left feeling its importance for themselves, and feeling a part of a greater movement. Or, as my friend put it: “They became Champions”.

We had just a short one-and-a-half days together, but we accomplished so much. In addition to bringing environmental scientists together to meet for the first time, we also included a software developer and a leader in the open science movement, which combined the communities Openscapes aims to bridge and which energized us all with new perspectives and concrete checklists. We discussed issues big and small (from how to get university support for open data science to how to use Google Docs’ Document Outline View), identified research collaborations, brainstormed a manuscript, skill-shared (data storage & backup tips, project management software, and more), and ended the whole summit with exchanging appreciation via sticky notes (something I learned from Mozilla) and a hike together in the Los Padres National Forest.

We had a good balance of structured time (to share progress, learn together, and plan out a manuscript) with unstructured time so Champions could build from our Openscapes discussions, talk science, and more generally get to know each other. We started off by sharing our Pathways, which is a way to think deliberately about (and track) reproducibility, collaboration, and communication within the lab by listing the tools and approaches used now and to help prioritize the next steps. At dinner, we had printouts of potential conversation topics – based on the conversations I had had with the Champions individually throughout the last few months that could benefit everyone (“ask Chelsea about hackathons”, “ask Nina about teaching straight from R for Data Science”).

> In the changing softwarescape, we are not experts, but how do we set up shared practices for our labs? It doesn’t have to be perfect, but it can be better. We can create a space where we can talk about data, a space and culture of learning because we know things will change.


Of our seven Champions, we had five at the Summit in person and one participating remotely. And we also had two special guests join (see below!). Throughout, everyone was logged into Zoom (with only one person’s audio on) so that anyone could quickly screenshare. This meant we were not limited to a conference room with monitors. We also used Zoom to record our conversations so Champions not there in person could learn from our discussions.

Dr. Christie Bahlai joined as us as a special guest for Friday morning to discuss open lab culture and championing open data science practices in ecology. [Dr. Bahlai is an applied quantitative ecologist](https://bahlailab.org/), professor at Kent State University, and Mozilla Fellow. We discussed strategies for creating and fostering a good culture in the lab, and learned about her lab’s procedures for onboarding ([Reproducible Quantitative Methods course](https://cbahlai.github.io/rqm-template/)) and offboarding ([Project completion checklist](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Project_completion.md)). We talked about how important it is for lab culture to deliberately think about what creates a digital citizens in terms of collaboration, data management, and working openly, and how teaching this is critical in addition to teaching statistics.

Sean Kross also joined us in person for the whole Summit – he is a PhD student at UC San Diego studying Human-Computer Interaction. [Sean's research interests](http://seankross.com/about/) include understanding how data scientific workflows effect research outcomes, creating tools for data science instructors, and making online education more humane and interactive. He was interested in hearing our conversations and *how* we are are thinking about data science in our labs. One incredibly cool moment was when Sean said “Hey Adrian, you know how you were hoping there was a way to sort through activity by user and repo within a GitHub organization? I coded that up this morning — see what you think”. We’ll have a followup about that, stay tuned.

Overall, I was amazed how engaged, energized, and open everyone was throughout our time together. It is a lot to ask for two full days of early career scientists’ time, particularly when they are already giving Openscapes four hours a month, and additionally working on Openscapes concepts with their labs. On Friday when we filmed individual interviews, there were over two hours of completely unstructured time at the AirBnB where I had hoped Champions would continue Openscapes discussions, strike up research conversations, but could also catch up on work or email if need be. It was so cool to me that during that time no one had their computers out; they were engaged in deep conversations and sharing experiences as scientists, as faculty, as teachers, and more. That meant so much to me, that my ultimate goal of having them connect more deeply as people dedicated to science and improving the scientific culture around them is really is taking root. And we’ll be building from this momentum – it is the best feeling in the world.
