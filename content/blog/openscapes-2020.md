*Openscapes' vision is a scientific culture that is more efficient and collaborative, and can uncover data-driven solutions faster. We engage and empower scientists with open data science, which not only increases transparency and reproducibility in science, but also enables [kinder science](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/). This is a brief recap of how we began doing this in 2019 and how we will continue in 2020.*

<!---We help grow communities of practice around environmental open data science, in part through mentoring early career researchers in leadership roles. --->


## 2019 Review

2019 was a big year for Openscapes, full of firsts, excitement, and a lot of learning. I created Openscapes through my fellowship with Mozilla, developing the Champions curriculum building from six years of [open data science lessons learned from the Ocean Health Index](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) and designing the Champions program modeled after [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). I also leveraged my own open data science skills, building Openscapes' digital infrastructure in R and GitHub, and had the awesomeness of working with NCEAS (and now also RStudio) Artist-in-Resident Allison Horst, who created all [original artwork for Openscapes](/gallery). We officially [launched Openscapes](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/introducing-openscapes-2cf8ed3b69d2) in October 2018 at MozFest in London.

From January-May 2019, we led the first cohort of Openscapes Champions: [seven research groups](https://www.openscapes.org/cohorts/) from five universities studying critical topics like marine food systems and ecological vectors of disease. During that time we focused on developing the [lesson series](https://openscapes.github.io/series), mentoring scientists each month (both one-on-one and as a full cohort of seven research groups), and amplifying their work and progress through [blog posts](/categories/champions/) and Twitter [@openscapes](https://twitter.com/openscapes). These science teams had so [many wins and momentum](/blog/2019/06/12/wins-cohort1/) during those five months, and still continue to strengthen culture and workflows around open data science.

The rest of 2019 was focused on sharing lessons from Openscapes and championing open data science broadly to many audiences. I gave the [opening keynote at the useR! 2019 conference](blog/2019/08/22/user-keynote/) in Toulouse, France and [co-authored a career column in *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) with the Champions group leads. I also published a [piece in *Scientific American*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/) about how open data science enables kinder culture — better for science and better for scientists. When my Mozilla Fellowship support ended I was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and also spent time developing a strategic plan and fundraising to continue Openscapes in 2020 and beyond.

## Openscapes 2020

In 2020, we will be building up Openscapes on several fronts. The priorities are mentoring more Champions cohorts, strengthening community engagement, and continuing to champion open data science. These go along well with our mission, which is to increase the visibility, value, and practice of open data science. 

**Champions cohorts.** This is what we love to do: mentor science teams and welcome them to open data science tools and communities. And leading more Champions cohorts is the future of Openscapes. Mozilla sponsored the first cohort of Openscapes Champions, and future cohorts can be sponsored or booked directly. There are several Champions cohorts that are in the works for direct booking — [learn more](/champions/#process) and [email us](mailto:openscapes@nceas.ucsb.edu) if you are interested. We are also leading our first 2-day Openscapes workshop in February, which will be an exciting way to catalyze open data science with cohorts of research groups in person.

**Community engagement.** Openscapes is all about building and strengthening communities of practice around open data science, and in 2020 we are excited to be able to focus on this more. 

**Championing open data science.** We have several exciting invited talks and keynotes coming up this year, stay tuned for more posts with official announcements! We are so thrilled for the opportunity to share lessons from Openscapes and share how powerful and empowering open data science tools and communities are for scientists. 

It's going to be an exciting year, thanks for being a part of it.
