# A conference for open data leaders

*I attended [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon in May 2019. Here are a few reflections about the conference and a bit about my talk where I shared progress from the Openscapes Champions.*

[csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/) has a unique name and draws a unique and powerful crowd as a "community conference for data makers everywhere". It is the only conference I've ever attended with a name stemming from a format for open data (comma separated value [CSV] files), and the only conference with scheduled time with a real-life therapy llama [Rojo the Comma Llama]. It was also the most diverse conference I've ever attended, and was a powerful nexus to meet leaders from all corners of the open data world.

This two-day conference included thought leaders, journalists, researchers, scientists, developers, artists, managers, activists, city planners. It included diversity of expertise, diversity of lived experience, diversity of thought. It included diversity of genders, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and had an upfront [Code of Conduct](https://confcodeofconduct.com/). The tone of csv,conf,v4 was like [the tone of the RStudio::conf](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/02/19/rstudioconf/): it was a welcoming, inclusive place where it was possible to strike up a conversation with anyone and immediately have opportunities to share and learn. Also, there were 8 (!) Mozilla Fellows past and present in attendance, which was really exciting (sadly, not pictured all together).

As a scientist, my entry way to the open community has been through open source software and communities like R, RStudio, rOpenSci and RLadies. Through Mozilla I am getting to know a bit more of the open community more broadly, and at csv,conf,v4 it was really impactful to see all of the ways that people think, work, and engage with open data. In all the conversations I had with people and from all the talks I saw I kept thinking that everyone at the conference was a leader. It might not be in their official job title, and they might be at csv,conf because of their official work or interests outside of work. But by attending and participating in this conference, they were there representing their communities and would be taking what they learned back with them.

It is hard to capture all of the people I met, things I learned, and conversations I had. The [organizing committee](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1126631979225534465) was incredible, leading the whole conference seamlessly despite a last minute venue change due to flooding. There are  [slides from all talks](https://zenodo.org/communities/csvconfv4) and will soon be [video recordings](https://www.youtube.com/csvconf) available online. One of the talks that sticks most prominently in my mind was by [@Srta_peperina](https://twitter.com/Srta_peperina) about [@GeochicasOSM](https://twitter.com/GeochicasOSM), Open Street Maps, and Las Calles de Las Mujeres. <!---Right now women make up only 3% of contributors to Open Street Maps, meaning that mechanics are mapped long before women's clinics. ---> Check out [#csvconf](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23csvconf) for more conversations and recaps: I loved this [summary thread by @GalaCF](https://twitter.com/GalaCF/status/1128102214843527168) and [keynote thread by @serahrono](https://twitter.com/serahrono/status/1130367733634338816).

But here is a short run-down of some of the impactful work I learned about: I learned about [frictionless data processing]() with oceanographers from Amber York and had further discussions with Amber and Lily Winfree about frictionless data tools and how scientists are using them. Alex Morley talked about choosing your own adventure and the [future of notebooks](), 

Two talks that stand out to me were about Open Street Maps
Las Calles de Las Mujeres was presented by @Srta_peperina from @GeochicasOSM -- its an amazing project that has mapped streets named after women in different places in #latinamerica and has linked to see how many of these women are in @Wikipedia

In [my talk](https://zenodo.org/record/2695625#.XN2CsKZ7nOQ) I shared about the awesome Openscapes Champions I have been working with, who are leaders in environmental science and now open data science. I've created [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) this year during my Mozilla Fellowship, and it complements existing efforts by welcoming & empowering scientists as labs and increases the visibility & value of open data science by amplifying labs.

Over the past four months I have been working with [seven environmental science labs at five universities](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/openscapes-champions-incorporate-open-practices-in-their-science-7eefa07b8573) â€” and sharing some of their progress and leadership over the past four months was so, so exciting. They have have created GitHub Organizations for their labs, and posted Codes of Conduct and shared protocols for data workflows and onboarding and offboarding lab members. They are leading [weekly lab "seaside chats"](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/) to discuss data workflows and normalize talking about open data science. They are joining and leading communities outside of their labs, including starting [#tidytuesday hacky hours](https://openscapes.org/blog/2019/05/02/tidy-tuesday-coding-club/) and the first RLadies chapter in New Jersey. They are being ambassadors & engaging with #rstats Twitter, sharing open science and #rstats resources with their scientific networks. They are starting new scientific collaborations as a result of meeting each other through this Openscapes cohort. And there are so many other wins that I am trying to measure and share, some of which are captured on this slide:

My own path getting to the Openscapes program is because of six years of encouraging mentorship and leadership from our OHI team. It is so exciting to pass forward what we have learned and empower others to be champions for open data science. And because they are open data leaders, maybe we will see some of them will be at csv,conf,v5!
