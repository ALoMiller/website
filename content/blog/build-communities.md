Openscapes is built with the idea that we can model the culture we want in academia. It starts with valuing and promoting open data science in our communities. So what can you do? All of the following involve seeking out opportunities to engage and learn, include others, and amplify your efforts. This is not a comprehensive list, please contact us with your ideas! 

### As a grad student

- read publications about open data science in academia in journal clubs. Examples:
  - [Lowndes et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
  - [Stevens et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/11/265421)
  - [others](http://ohi-science.org/news/importance-of-open-data-science-tools)
- ask your department for a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) workshop
- ask your department to offer data science courses
- join or [start a coding club](/blog/2018/11/16/how-to-start-a-coding-club/)
- join online communities and find allies. Recommended: 
    - [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)
    - [RStudio](https://community.rstudio.com/)
    - [RLadies](https://rladies.org)

### As faculty:

In addition to all the above,

- talk about open data science in your departments and faculty meetings
- teach a course (you can use [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and learn as you go, as one of our Champions as done!)
- include funding for open data science in grant proposals
- give your students time and space to learn
- support your students starting a coding club on campus
- support your lab having "data science" lab meetings
