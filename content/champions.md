Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice. 

<br>

## PURPOSE

This is a program for early career researchers who are in leaderships roles – faculty, lecturers, program managers, etc. – that provides them mentorship to employ and promote open data science practices in their labs and campuses. It complements other efforts seeking to fill a gap left by graduate education, which often lacks formal computing and data training. 

<!---Through mentorship meetings with Champions and members of their labs, Openscapes provides these emerging scientific leaders to have the opportunity to engage with existing open practices and guide their labs take the next steps appropriate for them.

**Openscapes helps scientists become visible champions for open data science practices and promote them through their labs, teaching, and departments.**

Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program for early career researchers in leadership roles (e.g. faculty, lecturers, program managers) that helps them become visible Champions for open practices. It is designed with the vision that although scientific leaders were not formally trained in open data science practices, they can value and enable these practices through their labs, teaching, and departments.

This is creating more scientists who promote something they value, not creating champions in the sports context.

## OUTCOMES

Being an Openscapes Champion means working towards an efficient, open culture within their lab, and modeling that behavior outwards to the broader campus community.

Openscapes Champions will be better equipped to achieve the following:

- Promote open data science practices in their labs and departments
- Enable an open culture in their lab, such as having
  - dedicated lab meetings to discuss data and reproducible workflows
  - stated code of conduct or lab philosophy
- Cultivate a local community of practice through coding clubs on campus (example: [Eco-Data-Science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/))

## PROCESS

Openscapes Champions is a five-month program designed to meet scientists where they are and help identify incremental steps to make their data workflows and lab culture more efficient and open.  

Openscapes empowers Champions by: 

1. mentoring scientists to become Champions for open practices; 
2. supporting Champions to improve open practices within their labs; and 
3. amplifying Champions’ stories and successes online.

The program is modeled after [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/), which operates remotely through both one-on-one mentorship and group lessons that also include lab members. Champions and their labs will strategize and set goals while building relationships with other labs and staying accountable. Note: “lab” is broadly defined.


<!---
You don’t have to be a mentee to get involved in the culture shift. We welcome members of the broader scientific and open community to join us

## MEET THE OPENSCAPES CHAMPIONS

Our inaugural cohort of 7 Champions started in January 2019 and includes a variety of scientists – from a marine aquaculture & fisheries scientist to a lecturer of environmental data science and an marine ecologist studying the impacts of climate change.

Stay tuned to learn their stories.
