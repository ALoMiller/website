Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program for scientists to create new champions for open data science and grow the community of practice in environmental science. 

Since formal computing and data training are often not part of environmental education, Openscapes mentors early career researchers in leadership roles (e.g. faculty, lecturers, program managers) and provides them with the opportunity to engage with open data science practices and champion them in their labs and departments.

<!---Through mentorship meetings with Champions and members of their labs, Openscapes provides these emerging scientific leaders to have the opportunity to engage with existing open practices and guide their labs take the next steps appropriate for them.

**Openscapes helps scientists become visible champions for open data science practices and promote them through their labs, teaching, and departments.**

Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program for early career researchers in leadership roles (e.g. faculty, lecturers, program managers) that helps them become visible Champions for open practices. It is designed with the vision that although scientific leaders were not formally trained in open data science practices, they can value and enable these practices through their labs, teaching, and departments.

## PURPOSE

The purpose of the Champions program is to welcome more scientists to the open tools, practices, and communities that can accelerate their research and help find environmental solutions faster. We complement existing efforts and communities by mentoring early career scientists — who frequently did not have formal computing training themselves — to value and enable these practices in their labs and departments. Being an Openscapes Champion means having an open culture within their lab, with behavior that is modeled outwards to the broader campus community.

<!---

This is creating more scientists who promote something they value, not creating champions in the sports context.

## OUTCOMES

The main outcome of the Openscapes Champions program is to create create new champions for open data science and grow the community of practice in environmental science.

There are also specific outcomes we expect of all Champions mentored through the program: 

- Champions promote open data science practices in their labs and departments
- Champions' labs engage with open data science practices
  - dedicated lab meetings to discuss data and reproducible workflows
  - stated code of conduct or lab philosophy
- Champions' labs join or start a coding club on campus (ex: [Eco-Data-Science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/))  

Additionally, since Champions have different starting points and will engage in different ways throughout the program, we will share their individual outcomes as stories.

## PROCESS

The Openscapes Champions program focuses on 1) mentoring scientists to become Champions for open practices; 2) supporting Champions to improve open practices within their labs; and 3) amplifying Champions’ stories and successes online.

The Openscapes Champions program is designed to meet scientists where they are and help identify incremental steps to make their data workflows more efficient and open. It is a five-month program modeled after [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). It is done remotely, and it is scalable because mentees can become mentors for incoming cohorts while the operations and lesson development stay with a small core team. It also means that we welcome members of the broader open community to [get involved](/contact/).

Champions will have one-on-one mentorship calls each month to discuss and strategize how to be more efficient, and to set, review, and meet goals. Additionally, there will be cohort calls twice each month with all Champions as well as members of their labs. Cohort calls are an opportunity to learn about existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and stay accountable. Note: "lab" is broadly defined.

## MEET THE OPENSCAPES CHAMPIONS

The inaugural cohort of 7 Champions starting in January 2019 was selected springing from informal conversations over several years. They include a marine aquaculture & fisheries scientist studying global systems, a lecturer of data science and statistics in an environmentally-focused graduate program, and an ecologist studying the impacts of climate change on ocean life.

As we progress, we will share stories from our Openscapes Champions here.
