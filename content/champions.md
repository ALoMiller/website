Openscapes Champions is a mentoring program for environmental scientists. We mentor early career researchers who are thought leaders in leadership roles. These scientists will become visible champions for open practices, and enable their lab groups to work openly.

The program is designed with the idea that scientific leaders can value and enable open practices, even before they become experts themselves. [reword!]  

<br>

## PURPOSE

The purpose of the Champions program is to welcome more scientists to the open tools, practices, and communities that can accelerate their research and help us find environmental solutions faster. We complement existing efforts and communities by mentoring early career scientists — who did not have formal computing training themselves — to value and enable these practices in their labs.

## OUTCOMES

The Champions program is designed to meet scientists where they are and help them take incremental steps towards better practices that make their work more efficient and open. Thus, outcomes during the Champions program will vary, and we will share them as stories for others to learn from and be inspired by. Additionally, there are specific outcomes we expect of all Champions: 

- Champions promote open practices in their talks and collaborations
- Champions labs have deliberate shared practices in the lab
  - dedicated lab meetings to discuss data and reproducible workflows
  - code of conduct or lab philosophy
- Champions lab members start a coding club on campus (ex: [Eco-Data-Science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/))  


What does being an Openscapes lab mean? It means having an open culture within the lab, with behavior that is modeled outwards to the broader campus community.

## PROCESS

Champions will have one-on-one mentorship calls each month to discuss and strategize how to be more efficient, and to set, review, and meet goals. Additionally, there will be cohort calls twice each month with all Champions as well as members of their labs. Cohort calls are an opportunity to learn about existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and keep accountable. Note: "lab" is broadly defined.

Openscapes Champions is a five-month program modeled after [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/), which means it is done remotely, and it is scalable because mentees can become mentors for incoming cohorts while the operations and lesson development stay with a small core team. It also means that we welcome members of the broader open community to [get involved](/contact/). [fix link]
