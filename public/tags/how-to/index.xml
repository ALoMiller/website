      <description>So you want to learn R, where do you start? There are a lot of written and video tutorials and books and blogs online, but how do you navigate them? Our Ocean Health Index team put together a list of the resources we used to learn R that helped our team&amp;rsquo;s path to better science in less time. But this might still not be helpful for where you should actually start.</description>

      <description>How to start a coding club Summary: start small, be hands-on, use existing tutorials, have fun.
Here is my advice for starting a coding club.
An example is Eco-Data-Science at UCSB. We are currently a community of &amp;gt;100 people; we meet 2x/month at the UCSB Library&amp;rsquo;s Collaboratory and skill share peer-to-peer, with all resources organized and archived on the website. But we started off small, with co-founder Jamie giving tutorials to friends one-on-one.</description>

      <description>[Draft in progress!]
The Openscapes program is built with the idea that we can model the culture we want in academia. So what can you do?
What you can do as a grad student  read nature at journal club request swc workshop ask your Dept to teach data science courses seek out opportunities to learn, amplify join or start a study group/coding club [use Twitter for science]() join online communities, find allies.</description>
